```

### Stacks
* ReactJS
* Redux (middleware: Redux-thunk)
* Next.js
The reason to use this framework is to achieve pre-rendering to optimize the performance. Also, I can add something in the head section to improve SEO like description, author, keywords, etc.
* Styled-components
The reason to use this framework is that it can help me to avoid CSS pollution. Also, it has already done the CSS reset and it's convenient to use.
